## Features

<img src="./src/assets/images/Readme3.png" align="center"/>

- Measured is all about quality, curated recipes, written in plain English — so you get all of the booze, less of the bullshit, and... definitely no blue cocktails.
- Our homepage displays a range of cocktail recipes, including a feature recipe, scrollable galleries of cocktails based on flavour/type, and — if you're logged in — a 'top shelf' of your favourite drinks.
- Anyone can browse the cocktail collection or look at instructions for individual drinks, which have badges to indicate the number of ingredients they include. You can use the search bar to dynamically filter or search specific recipes, based on name, ingredient or flavour category.
- Anyone can also use our build-a-drink cocktail creator, which provides instructions on the basic formula for different cocktails, and lets you test flavour combinations. It suggests cocktails from our collection based on your preferred 'build'.
- Users can create a Measured account or login through Google Authentication. Once logged in, you'll get access to our 'My Bar' page, which lets you browse ingredients, add the ones you have at home, and suggests cocktails you can make based on the ingredients you already have.
